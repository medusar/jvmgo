# jvmgo
simple jvm written in go, based on a tutorial, for learning go only!

1. The tutorial book is called 《自己动手写Java虚拟机》(Build your own JVM) can be found [here](https://item.jd.com/11935272.html)
2. All the codes in this project is coded by myself, based on the instructions and demos, with little change anyway, mainly for practice.
